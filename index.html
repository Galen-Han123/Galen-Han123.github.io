<h2 class="title">The Idea of Creating This Repository</h2>
<p class="ppp">I am really interested in science fictions because the writer magically conbines reality and imagination.Good science fictions are always based on strict science theories which are utilised by writers to grdually build up the extraordinary fiction empire.Every technology which is inconceivable now appears in science fictions,and the most amazing thing is that writers can bring readers illusions that these technologies seem to be available now.This is the reason why I love science fictions and I even write my own science fiction which will be presented in this website later.By the way,I want to recommend you guys a science fiction called'The Three-Body Problem' written by Liu Cixin.I believe many of you having heard about it.But do you finish reading it?Actually,The Three-Body Problem is a serieof three books,which are The Three-Body problem,The Dark Forest and Death's End.For me,I only finished two of them,but I heard that my English teacher loves 'The Dark Forest'best.I totally agree with it because I am really impressed with the fluctuate plots and the serious questions of humanity.To know more information about'The Three-Body Problem',I recommend you<a href="https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/211046363.html">Short introduction about The Three-Body Problem</a>All in all, I really wish you guys to read this <b>unprecedented masterpeice!!! </b></p>
